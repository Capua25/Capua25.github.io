    <main>
		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I consider myself as a person with wide knowledge about technology and a fast learner. I'm also good at logical-mathematical thinking. I am currently focused on programming, aiming to live from it, wich is my main goal. Now Iâ€™m working at Eurogen S.R.L. as software developer and IT consultant and manager.</p>
		<Card title="My history">
			<p>After graduating from highschool I started an engineering career in mechatronic and learned a lot of things including programming in <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Assembler</strong>. Later, in that career I realized that I didn't want to work in that field, instead I wanted to have a job as a programmer, so I left the career and started to learn more things self-taught. On that way I did get my nowadays job as software developer and I started learning web developing. I've made some pages and simple apps for me and now I'm working as a freelance web-dev.</p>
